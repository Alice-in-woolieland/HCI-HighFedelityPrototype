Hello! Thank you so much for working on this.

As you can see, I have all of the buttons layed out,
as well as 2 of the info boxes.

#What I need you to do are the following:
- Work on infoboxes
    + Add more infoboxes overall.
    + Populate them with information
    + Make sure their ID's match the buttons they link to
    + As they are the newest feature they are prone to bugs,
      please let me know if there are any weird ones
- Update buttons with the showAndHide() function.
    + just add the onClick attribute, and set the value to "showAndHide()".
      Then, within the show and hide function set the value to the buttons name
      (which should be the ID of the corresponding infobox)
      EX: <div id="r1button" class="button" onClick="showAndHide('staff')">
    + Then test for bugs!

#TIPS:
1. Do not be afraid to mess around a bit! If something breaks just undo it. (I will label things that you shouldn't mess with.)
2. Go wild with the formatting inside of the infoboxes. I have them set up to avoid breaking.
3. Commit every time you make a change that works or hit a break point. It's quick and easy, and if you make a mistake I can roll it back! So there's no loss.
4. W3 schools and MDN webdocs are your friends, reference them when stuck.
5. Web development is one of the few places stackoverflow does Not help in.
   Do not reference them please trust me it'll only make it worse in 99% of cases.

#Final words
I'll be available around 11pm, and probably available till 2am.
Let me know if you run into any bugs, or manage to break anything. Stress testing is important and letting me know of these things is very useful.

Also, I'm sorry for dumping this on you so late, it took me a long time to get this set up properly. Also I understand it looks bad right now, I'm going to make it look ~modern~ tonight.
